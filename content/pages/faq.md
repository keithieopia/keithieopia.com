About This Site

<dl class="faq">
    <dt>How do you pronounce Keithieopia?</dt>
    <dd>
        It's pronounced "Key-Th-Ee-Oh-Pea-Ah", some shorten it to just "Key-Th-Oh-Pea-Ah". "Your Site" works fine too.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>How did you come up with Keithieopia anyway?</dt>
    <dd>
        I once joked about how something trivial should be illegal in high school. My teacher joked backed saying I 
        should rule my own country where it could be illegal. I ran with the joke and wrote a mock constitution the next 
        day. For the fake nation's name I simply combined my last name with a random country on the map: Ethiopia.

    <dt>Why choose that for a domain name?</dt>
    <dd>
        When I went to register a domain name, everything I thought of was already taken. Later that night I found my 
        journal from high school that had the mock constitution inside it. Keithieopia was a pretty unique and wasn't 
        taken, so I registered that domain for my personal site.

Growing Up & Family
-------------------

<dl class="faq">

    <dt>What were you like when you were a kid?</dt>
    <dd>
        I did well in school and got good grades. Socially, I floated around social groups but stayed away from the 
        popular kids. I also wore a lot of hawaiian shirts, but nobody had style in their grade school years...
    </dd>
    
    <dt>What did you want to be when you grew up?</dt>
    <dd>
        A mathematician, believe it or not. PBS use to have show called "MathNet", which obviously a spoof on Dragnet. 
        The main characters where mathematicians that solved crime using math. When I learned most mathematicians don't 
        solve crimes, I switched to wanting to be a scientist. 
    </dd>

    <dt>Do you have brothers and sisters?</dt>
    <dd>
        None; I'm an only child. I do not have any regrets about not having brothers or sisters. The concept is probably 
        just as foriegn to me as to people with siblings imagining life without them. 
    </dd>

    <dt>What's your family like?</dt>
    <dd>
        I'm very close with my parents, even as an adult. My Father was my best man at my wedding and if I had a tattoo, 
        it probably would be a heart with "Mom" written in it. I love my wife unconditionally, and she's my best friend.

Personality
-----------
<dl class="faq">
    <dt>Are you a dog or cat person?</dt>
    <dd>
        I'm more of a fish person, I love aquariums and have had fish since childhood. To directly answer the question, 
        I really don't care for cats, but I do tend to like older small dogs.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Describe yourself in a few words.</dt>
    <dd>
        I'm introverted, thorough, organized, and hard working. I'm also creative, musical, and have a sense of humor.  
    </dd>
    
    <dt>What's your worse personality trait?</dt>
    <dd>
        My best trait is my attention to detail, my worse trait is also my attention to detail. I try to put my best 
        effort into everything I do, which produces higher quality at the expense of more time. 
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Do you have any pet peeves?</dt>
    <dd>
        Unfortunately many, but the biggest one is "mouth noises" such as chewing with your mouth open, dogs licking 
        themselves, or chewing nails. Visually I could care less, hearing it is another matter. Strange, no?
    </dd>

    <dt>Which sports do you like?</dt>
    <dd>
        I find most mainstream sports boring (football, soccer, baseball, etc). I'm a big fan of sumo wrestling. I also 
        enjoy watching Scottish highland games, Lumberjack, and Strongman competitions.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>How can I get to know you?</dt>
    <dd>
        Many people say this, but I'm legitimately hard to get to know: I'm not very outgoing and I don't have many 
        mainstream interests. Beyond technology topics, I enjoy discussing movies and music as well as general trivia. 
        I pass on many social gatherings, but I can't resist a get together to play board games of any variety.

Just for Fun
------------

<dl class="faq">
    <dt>Can you tell me your favorite bedtime story?</dt>
    <dd>
        Not so much a story but a book, "Goodnight, Moon". I liked the detailed pictures and the colors. I also fondly 
        remember trying to find the mouse each picture.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>If you had to give yourself a new name, what would it be?</dt>
    <dd>
        I really like my name and my first, middle, and last name actually have meaning. However if I had to, "Xavier" 
        is pretty neat sounding and I could sign my name easily with a big "X". 
    </dd>
    
    <dt>If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you travel to?</dt>
    <dd>
        Wales in the United Kingdom. I hear it's very beautiful and doesn't have larger crowds of tourists like London.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>If you won a million dollars, what would you do?</dt>
    <dd>
        I'd probably buy a small house and new car, nothing impressive or showy. The rest I'd split between saving and 
        investing in government bonds. I'd still work at my job and wouldn't change my dress or the way I act.

Philosophical Questions
-----------------------
<!-- http://www.goodquestionstoask.com/deep.htm -->

<dl class="faq">
    <dt>Who has influenced you the most in your life?</dt>
    <dd>
        My third grade elementary school librarian, Ms. Mackle. She always would end a lesson with the quote, "Reading is 
        knowledge, knowledge is power". I took that to heart and I owe all my knowledge, education, skills, and success 
        to not reading or books, but a humble librarian who spoke all but 6 words to a class full of children decades ago. 
    </dd>

    <dt>What is the biggest lesson you've learned in life?</dt>
    <dd>
        Be yourself, it's one of the most difficult lessons in life because you have to have confidence in yourself and 
        know who you are.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Do you see the glass as half empty or half full?</dt>
    <dd>
        If I am thirsty, the glass has water and can hold more. If not, I won't be wasteful if I don't drink it. My 
        outlook depends on my wants, but my needs of water are met in both cases.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Do you think that people are born basically good or basically bad?</dt>
    <dd>
        I don't believe anyone is born good or bad; rather their character, outlook on life, and actions are a by-product 
        of their environment. It's really hard at times, but I try to reflect and try to find good in people that have 
        wronged others so that I can grow myself. 
    </dd>
    
    <dt>Do you think people can control their own destinies?</dt>
    <dd>
        I do feel we are guided in certain directions, but which way we go and what we explore along the way is 
        completely left to us and our free will.
    </dd>
    
    <dt>What would a utopian society be to you?</dt>
    <dd>
        Everyone co-existing and respecting each other's differences. Closely followed by, everyone embracing who they 
        are with no desires to be like anyone else or change to better fit in. Utopian maybe, but ultimately achievable.
