Education
=========
Despite having a learning disability my entire life, I was able to succeed throughout my academic career, proving anything 
is possible with the right mindset and hard work.

I graduated in the summer of 2010 with a Master's of Forensic Science with a concentration in High Technology Crime 
Investigation from [The George Washington University](http://www.gwu.edu/). My sub-concentrations included Computer 
Forensics and Network Intrusion.

For my undergraduate degree, I went to [Edinboro University of Pennsylvania](http://www.edinboro.edu/) and graduated
*cum laude* in 2008 with a Bachelor of Arts in Criminal Justice. It was a four year degree program, however I was able 
to complete it in three years with two additional minors in Political Science and Music. My independant study was in 
*3D Virtual Reality Crime Scene Reconstruction* and my undergraduate thesis was *Open Source Software for Law Enforcement*.

Prior to my higher education, I was the in [Patuxent High School](http://phsweb.calvertnet.k12.md.us)'s graduating class 
of 2005. In addition to my High School Diploma, I also received the Maryland Certificate of Merit for a cumulative GPA 
of 3.00 or higher.
