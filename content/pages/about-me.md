Hello, I'm Timothy Keith. I'm an enthusiastic [computer nerd](./?p=computers) that has a surprising level of social 
skills, given my fellow kin. I live in what is locally known as "Southern Maryland", for residents of other countries, 
Maryland is in the United States of America. I'm technically was born in Generation Y, although I look much older for my 
age and identify and prefer the company of Gen Xers. 

Fellow geeks and people in HR call me a "System Administrator"... <em>whatever that means</em>. I equate my line of work 
with my favorite toy growing up: Lego bricks. Now that I'm an adult, I still make bigger things out of smaller pieces. I 
regularly make computer networks, programs, and websites among other things. Sometimes a small piece breaks and I have 
to replace it, but mostly I'm tasked with anticipating these problems before they occur.

In my spare time, I tend to do the same exact things at home as at work... but when you do what you love, why ever stop? 
I'm an lifelong learner and have succeeded throughout my [academic career](./?p=education), despite having a 
[disability](./?p=disability). I love reading, especially to gain additional knowledge and skills. For the most part, my 
computer knowledge was self taught through many years of reading. I also have taught myself through reading basic 
woodworking, electrical wiring, and various other handyman trade skills I enjoy doing as a hobby.

One hobby I was actually taught is how to play the [bagpipes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Highland_Bagpipe), which 
I started learning around eleven. I consider myself an intermediate at playing the pipes, although only play for fun and 
don't compete. I also play a variety of other instruments such as [Shuttle Pipes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Pipes), 
fipple flutes like [native american flutes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_flute) and 
[tin whistles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tin_whistle) which have similar fingering to the bagpipes, and the 
[upright string bass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_bass), which I learned all through middle school to college.

I'm happily married to my wonderful wife, Kerri. Kerri has almost the completely opposite personality that I have, which 
is the perfect balance to us as a couple. While I can't say enough great things about her, the key to finding a partner 
is the realization nobody is perfect. Once you've found that person, the key to unlocking a life long relationship is the 
realization that they are perfect for you. Kerri is not perfect, but Kerri is perfect for me.
