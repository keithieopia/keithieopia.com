My Learning Disability
======================
For all my life I have had a disability called Central Auditory Processing
Disorder (CAPD). People with CAPD have great difficulty understanding what
others say, especially when in noisy environments such as cafeterias,
playgrounds, gyms, bars, and public sporting events.

Unlike people that are deaf or those that wear hearing aids, CAPD does
not occur due to damage to the ear, but rather how the brain interpretes
the signals that get sent from the ear. It is also unrelated to those that
have mental conditions such as low IQ's.

With me, the disorder manifests itself similarly to the teachers in Charlie
Brown; you can "hear" that the person is talking, but cannot understand
what they are saying. Sometimes it even "sounds" similar to that
"wah wah wah" effect in the cartoon.

Despite my disadvantage, I have been able to overcome my disability and
succeed. However it's always present in my life and there is no cure or
medicine for CAPD.

To College and Beyond: My Success Story
---------------------------------------
I was first diagnosed with CAPD in elementary school and attended special
classes a few days out of the week which taught coping strategies. All
the way to my high school graduation, I had an accommodation plan that
provided some minor (but essential) accommodations such as written notes
if the class was mostly verbal instruction.

I took orchestra from Middle School all the way through High School which
I learned CAPD isn't necessarily limited to difficulty understanding
speech alone, but anything auditory such as playing instruments in a band.
In High School, I also challenged myself further by taking a foreign
language for all four years despite having difficulty understanding my
native language. It's been awhile, but I still remember enough German to
definitively state, "Ich spreche Deutsch nicht sehr gut".

In College, my disability was documented and I was actually entitled by
the college to the same services and even more if needed. I made it a
personal goal not to use these services once during my entire academic
career. I graduated *cum laude*, and in addition to my honor stole,
I also wore honor cords from the Delta Alpha Pi (an international honor
society for students with disabilties), for academic achievement while
overcoming a disability.

I then went on to obtain my Master's degree, this time without
documenting my disability so I wouldn't have the mental safety net of
services if I need them should I have difficulty. Not using services in
college and not even requesting them in graduate school made the journey
much more difficult than what other students encountered, but was
incredibly rewarding in the end and I was able to prove to myself that
anything is possible if you put your mind to it and are willing to work
hard enough to achieve your goals.
