Contact Me
==========

The easiest way to contact me is via my email address: <a href="&#109;a&#105;lt&#111;:%74&#105;&#109;&#111;%74&#104;&#121;&#64;%6be&#105;%74hie&#111;&#112;%69%61&#46;%63&#111;&#109;">t&#105;&#109;&#111;t&#104;&#121;&#64;ke&#105;th&#105;e&#111;&#112;ia&#46;c&#111;&#109;</a>.
If you want me to read your email, please use a sensible subject line otherwise 
I might mistake your message for spam. 

Most people don't read this far, but since you have here's a secret: 
include the word "ZIGGY" anywhere in the subject line and my email client 
will whitelisted and highlight your email. If you're wondering, Ziggy is 
the super computer that helps Sam and Al from the 90's TV show "Quantum 
Leap". 

For sensitive information, you can encrypt the email with my PGP 
key [5B575AB0](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x3F0E7E765B575AB0). 
I use [Bitmessage](https://bitmessage.org/wiki/Main_Page) occasionally, 
my address is: *BM-NBX5UVnzTakK8yTGFzNTudEMeFtgGQmA*. 

While surprising to some, I'm not very active online. I do have some social 
network profiles, however I usually only follow people or organizations 
I personally know. I reserve Facebook for communicating with close friends.
