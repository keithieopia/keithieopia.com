For those that have never heard of it, [Footprints in the Sand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Footprints_%28poem%29) is an popular religious poem with a disputed origin ultimately resulting in a [lawsuit](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/31/AR2008053101998.html). I had wanted to feature this beautiful poem on decorative sign, but found the ugly nature of it's legal status to be off-putting.

After some research and legal advice, I found that two doctrines called [fair-use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use) and [transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_%28law%29) would allowed me to use *Footprints in the Sand*, so long as it was my own take on it. There's two or three versions (all disputed), so I read all three, a paragraph at a time, and wrote down what I remembered.

In October of 2014, I completed my version and made the decorative sign. The result is something new that uses more modern English. Since the poem has such a great message, and out of frustration with its murky copyright status, I decided to [dedicate my version to the public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). Feel free to use it with *or without* attribution or permission.

> **Footprints in the Sand**

> One night I dreamed I was walking on the beach with God. Many scenes from my life flashed before me. In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand, sometimes two sets, other times only one.

> This bothered me because during the lowest and saddest times in my life, there was only one set of footprints. So I asked God,

> "God, you told me when I decided to follow you, that you would walk with me all the way. But I noticed during the most trying times there has only been one set of footprints. Why when I needed you most, were you not there for me?"

> God whispered, "My child, I would never ever leave you! During your times of trial and suffering when you saw only one set of footprints it was then that I carried you."
