It's a new year over at CVS Pharmacy and a perfect time to change phone tree
options since <em><abbr title="me">someone</abbr></em> posted an [opt-out guide](/posts/2017-08-10-stop-cvs-robo) and an [investigative journalist](https://abc13.com/news/abc13-gets-cvs-automated-prescription-calls-to-stop/1776140/) wrote an expos√© on the annoying calls.

Not all heros wear capes, and in this case <em>Greg S.</em> wrote to me with an
updated 2019 guide. In May, <em>Robert A.</em> contacted me with some helpful addendums.<!--more-->

Do the following from the phone that is receiving the CVS robocalls (as in don't call from your cell if it's your landline getting the calls). CVS uses 
[anonymous call rejection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_call_rejection), so if your phone number is private or blocks Caller ID, you'll also 
need to add [*82](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/*82) to the below phone number:

<ol>
  <li>Dial <strong>1-800-746-7287</strong>
  <li>Say <em>"More choices"</em>
  <li>Say <em>"Calls"</em>
  <li>The automated system will confirm your phone number, then...
  <li>Say <em>"Stop"</em>
  <li>Say <em>"Correct"</em>
</ol>

I want to give a shout out to everyone else that took time out of their day to send me emails thanking me for the original guide. Those kind words continue to motivate me.
