The easiest way to contact me is via my email address: [timothykeith@gmail.com](mailto:diomhair@protonmail.com).
Please use a sensible subject line so I don't accidentally mistake your message for spam.

If you prefer not to use Google, I also have an alternative email at: [diomhair@protonmail.com](mailto:diomhair@protonmail.com). D&#xEC;omhair means *secret* or *private* in Scots Gaelic, among [other translations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C3%AComhair).


## GPG / OpenPGP / PGP
If you're privacy conscious, feel free to encrypt any messages using my [public key](/uploads/timothykeith.pub.asc). If you prefer, my key is also available on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/timothykeith), the fingerprint is:

> 46E6 9F69 90C1 DE8C 9791 88EE 94A4 E2D4 *6B32 AA11*

You can import it directly into [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) into your keyring by running the following:

{{< highlight console >}}
$ curl http://keithieopia.com/uploads/timothykeith.pub.asc | gpg --import -
{{< / highlight >}}

If you're wondering why I'm not uploading my keys to a public key server such as pgp.mit.edu, the SKS software currently doesn't support Curve25519 keys yet.
