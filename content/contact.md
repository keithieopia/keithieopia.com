The easiest way to contact me is via my email address: [timothykeith@gmail.com](mailto:timothykeith@gmail.com).
Please use a sensible subject line so I don't accidentally mistake your message for spam.

## GPG / OpenPGP / PGP
If you're privacy conscious, feel free to encrypt any messages using my [public key](https://keithieopia.com/uploads/keithieopia.asc). If you prefer, my key is also available on [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/timothykeith), the fingerprint is:

<code>
46E6 9F69 90C1 DE8C 9791 88EE 94A4 E2D4 6B32 AA11
</code>

You can import it directly into [GnuPG](https://gnupg.org/) into your keyring by running the following:

<code class="shell">
curl https://keithieopia.com/uploads/keithieopia.asc | gpg --import -
</code>

If you're wondering why I'm not uploading my keys to a public key server such as pgp.mit.edu, the SKS software currently doesn't support Curve25519 keys yet.
