Hello, my name is Timothy Keith. But first, a poem:

> I'm Nobody! Who are you?  
> Are you &mdash; Nobody &mdash; too?  
> Then thereâ€™s a pair of us!  
> Don't tell! they'd advertise &mdash; you know!  
>  
> How dreary &mdash; to be &mdash; Somebody!  
> How public &mdash; like a Frog &mdash;  
> To tell one's name &mdash; the livelong June &mdash;  
> To an admiring Bog!  
>  
> &mdash; Emily Dickinson *(1891)*


## What does Dickinson have to do with your "About Me" page?

A contemporary interpretation of that poem, we all can relate to:

| Us, on Social Media&hellip; | Us, in Real Life&hellip; |

Everyone usually agrees with the adage *"nobody's perfect"*, but contrary to that, we feel great social pressure to paint an idealised version of ourselves online.

It certainly feels wrong to call ourselves a *nobody*, as we're all unique individuals. But if we were all perfect, we wouldn't be all different. And if we weren't all different, we would truly be *nobody*, as we'd be indistinguishable from each other. Think of how boring a world would be where everyone was the same!

*So maybe that means it's OK to be not perfect.*

## All you need to know about me&hellip;
I am not perfect. My imperfections are what makes me, *me*. It feels like such a skimpy statement to share about myself, but I feel it's the biggest admission you can make publically. Join me in celebrating our differences, and more importantly, our wonderful imperfections.

> You've made this day a special day, by just your being you.  
> There's no person in the whole world like you;  
> and I like you just the way you are.  
>  
> &mdash; Fred Rogers, *Mister Rogers' Neighborhood*
