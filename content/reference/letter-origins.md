This page lists the known origins of each of the alphabet letters. Most people know the English language uses the Latin alphabet as it's a descendant of Latin. We can actually trace the providence even farther: Latin evolved from Greek, Greek from Phoenician, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics.

### G
<a name="g"></a>

Latin based Languages such as Italian, French, and German used "I" and "J"

In English, the current pronunciation of "J" was borrowed from French and came 
into popularity around 1600 AD

<a name="u"></a>

"V" at the beginning of words for style purposes.

English borrows the pronunciation (as with the word **w**orse) from Old German 
where it was written as two letter U's or V's connected together.

Around 1400 AD, it became a separate letter in the Latin alphabet: the 
pronunciation of the letter's name, "Double U", is from the first form that was 
used, "uu".

now extinct letter "yogh"
