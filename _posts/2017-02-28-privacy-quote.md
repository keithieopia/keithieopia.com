title: Nazis Misappropriated My Privacy!

Given all the renewed interest in privacy rights in the so-called
*Post Snowden Era*, I'd thought I'd clarify a misattributed quote floating
around:

> You have nothing to fear, if you have nothing to hide

Since 2011, the phrase has been used as a
[common retort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument) to
privacy concerns. In recent years, privacy advocates have turned the tables
attributing the quote to Joseph Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda of Nazi
Germany.

Since nobody wants to be on the side of Nazis, the quote is now associated with
pro-privacy. However, [Godwin's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law)
begs us to be skeptical on the source.

Secondary attribution generally lies with George Orwell's famous book, 1984.
Keen readers will remember *Big Brother* and the all-seeing telescreens:

> It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any
> public place or within range of a telescreen ... anything that carried with it
> the suggestion of abnormality, of having something to hide ... was itself a
> punishable offense.
>
> &mdash; George Orwell, *1984 (Book 1, Chapter 5)*

Except that our *"nothing to fear, nothing to hide"* quote isn't Nazi or Big
Brother. Even O'Brien in Room 101 quickly points out *The Party* isn't
interested in what you're hiding:

> We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The
> Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We
> do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I
> mean by that?
>
> &mdash; George Orwell, *1984 (Book 3, Chapter 2)*

## So if not Orwellian or Fascist, what? 
The quote actually was penned by Upton Sinclair, the author of the influential 
book, *[The Jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jungle)*. Sinclair used 
our quote twice in his *Dead Hand* series. Readers looking for closure will be
disappointed to learn that the original context was used both *for* and
*against* privacy:

### Sinclair for Privacy
> Not merely was my own mail opened, but the mail of all my relatives and
> friends&mdash; people residing in places as far apart as California and Florida. I
> recall the bland smile of a government official to whom I complained about
> this matter: "**If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear.**"
>
> &mdash; Upton Sinclair, *The Profits of Religion (1918)*

### Sinclair for Surveillance
> From first to last **I had nothing to hide, and for that reason I had nothing
> to fear**, and this was as well known to the newspapers as it was to the
> police who were probing the explosion.
>
> Upton Sinclair, *The Brass Check (1919)*
