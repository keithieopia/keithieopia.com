I enjoy reading about other countries and cultures, so it's no surprise I 
frequent international websites. One reoccurring misconceptions I come across is 
that non-Americans believe "American" means something beyond national borders.

For non-Americans, it's best to think of U.S. states as independent countries 
with their own law and culture. Consider *United States* analogous to the 
European Union. For instance, there's a commonly believed trope that practically 
all Americans own guns. The state of New Mexico fits this stereotype well, as a 
lot of its residents can be seen freely walking around with a gun holster 
on their belt.

In the state of Maryland, that's basically illegal if you're not a police 
officer. Our gun laws are strict and a sudden change in them would probably 
cause mass panic and hysteria. That has nothing to do with my personal beliefs, 
it's just the culture of the state. As you probably guessed, I live there.

Even within Maryland, there's regions with noticeable different culture, 
accents, and slang words. I live in Calvert County, which is considered part of 
*Southern Maryland* or the *Tri-County area*. While it's only an hour's drive to 
D.C. or Baltimore, most Southern Marylanders would scoff at being lumped in with 
such villainy.

Even food within the U.S. can cause issues if introduced to a different region.
There's a Maryland seasoning called *Old Bay* that's officially used on seafood. 
In practice, we put it on everything: hamburgers, french fries, corn on the cob, 
fried chicken, etc. It's so pervasive that most restaurants by include a can on 
the table by default.

I let a few of my Northern Pennsylvanian friends to try it on Boardwalk Fries, 
hwoever *Old Bay* is somewhat of an acquired taste (it's made out of paprika, 
celery salt, and mustard among other things). I would not be exaggerating if I 
said one friend got physically sick and the rest where convinced I was lying 
about it's popularity in Maryland. 

Expanding our scope illustrates America's differences even clearer. People from 
the *Deep South* (think Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc.) probably wouldn't 
understand a *New Englander* (New York, Massachusetts, Maine, etc) if they asked
for "[Pop](http://popvssoda.com/)". People moving from the *West Coast* to 
*East Coast* (or vice versa) are worse off, as they typically experience 
cultural shock and difficulty fitting in to the same extent of someone who has 
moved to a foreign country.

While the U.S. certainly doesn't have as big of a population as other countries, 
it's more of the size of the land in between that causes these regional 
differences. Going back to humble Calvert County, it's bigger than 
[Singapore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore) or the [Isle of Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_Man)!
Up the scale, and the entire U.S. is larger than Australia, more than double the 
European Union, and 38 times larger than the British Islands. Now consider the 
differences within those areas I mentioned and look back at the U.S.

The take home message of all this is that the U.S. is more "diverse" than it is 
"united". While most Americans never leave the country, they really don't have 
too. Each state and region has considerable differences in culture, food, and 
even the law that might as well make it a different country.
