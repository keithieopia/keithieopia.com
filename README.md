## Development
[Rake](https://ruby.github.io/rake/) is used to aid development and automate 
building the site, in a similar fashion to a Makefile or using Grunt. 

**To build the site, outputs to `_site` directory:**
```console
$ rake build
```

**To build and start Jekyll's temporary http server:**
```console
$ rake serve
```
