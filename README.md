> I have a website because it's an interesting tool... It's become an archive and a fairly complete on-line portfolio, as well as offering an opportunity to write a little.

This is the source code for my personal website, [http://keithieopia.com](https://keithieopia.com). The final HTML & CSS is excluded; the site is statically generated on the fly by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), a static site generator written in Go. See the Development section for details on how to do this.

The site has been online since 2006 and open-sourced since 2013. Since then, it's back end has undergone many revisions; see the [CHANGELOG.md](https://gitlab.com/keithieopia/keithieopia.com/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for details.


## Development
[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_%28software%29) is used to aid development and automate all the steps required to build the site. The Makefile understands these commands:

- `make yarn` - Uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to download any site dependances or updates to them, then moves them into the correct folder
- `make build` - Runs `make yarn` and builds the site with Hugo
- `make dev` - Watch files for changes and automatically rebuild the site. Also, starts a built-in HTTP server and opens the default browser to see changes.
- `make push` - Runs both `make yarn` and `make build`, then uploads the site to my webserver


## Credits
See the [humans.txt](https://gitlab.com/keithieopia/keithieopia.com/blob/master/static/humans.txt) file, which lists in detail all the third party components this site uses. Alternatively, the site's [colophon](https://keithieopia.com/colophon/) provides a high-level overview with a description of the server environment.
