Terms of Service
----------------
Most website's terms of service can be boiled down to the wisdom of two philosophizers, William "Bill" S. Preston Esq.
and Theodore "Ted" Logan, III:

  1. Be excellent to each other, and...
  2. *PARTY ON, DUDES!*

While not part of the above two legally binding terms, it's suggested you go out and do something nice for someone
else with all that time saved not having to read a long TOS.

Privacy Policy
--------------
I promise to keep your information private, mainly by not to asking for what I don't need; so simple it's brilliant!

### What information do you collect?
Keithieopia uses an awesome analytics tool called [Piwik](http://piwik.org/) that collects
[information provided](https://panopticlick.eff.org/) by your browser. If you're a secret agent or just value privacy,
you can set the "[Do Not Track](http://donottrack.us/)" setting in your browser and Piwik will not record your visit.

### Do you use cookies?
Besides Piwik, Keithieopia uses cookies for logging into accounts. This is to make sure you're who you say you are and
not a shapeshifting M-113 salt creature.

Most browsers have a setting to reject cookies. Keithieopia will continue to function without cookies, however the login
system will not work.

### Do you disclose any information to outside parties?
I will not share or sell any private information that you provide because evidently I've already made my millions from
winning the Nigerian lottery over 9000 times.

From time to time I might share statistical data from Piwik to the general public, but I'll thoroughly scrub it with
bleach and anonymise it beforehand.

### Children's Online Privacy
Keithieopia does not collect any information relating to age. Should it be made known someone under the age of thirteen
has created an account on this site, I will remove it and strongly suggest their parents purchase them a Playstation 4
instead.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act
Keithieopia doesn't operate out of California. However, because we like shopping in *California, Maryland* we won't
distribute any of the imaginary personal information we don't collect. I reserve the right to recant that promise and
make up some fake information to share should the *Bath &amp; Body Works* go out of business, mainly out of spite that
I'll smell bad.

Contacting Me
-------------
Any questions regarding a certain secret plot to steal the flying monkeys from Wicked Witch of the West using old reruns
of Hogan's Heroes will be denied vehemently. For any other questions or if you have flying monkey cages for sale please
feel free to [contact me](./?p=contact).

Revisions to these Policies
---------------------------
If I decide to add some more snarkiness to this site's policies, I'll update this page... Duh. The last time this
happened was:
