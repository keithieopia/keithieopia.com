My Computers
============
I perfer to use a laptop as my main workhorse because of it's portability. It's a "desktop replacement" so it has a 
larger screen and a full size keyboard with number pad. When I'm traveling, I usually use my netbook instead due to it's 
low replacement cost and small size.

Everyone goofs off now and then, but my laptop is used almost exclusively for work. For all my movie watching, game 
playing, and book reading needs, I have my tablet. I usually don't have the time or patience to play immersive games with
impressive graphics, so the tablet works great for the few time wasters I do enjoy now and then. 

I use to hate "smart" phones and thought they where all mostly a status symbol. Now that I have one, it plays a critical 
role in organizing my life and allowing me access to quickly lookup information from anywhere. 


Software
--------
I'm a Linux user and use a tailor made [Arch Linux](http://www.archlinux.org/) install versus a heavyweight distribution 
like [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) with a pre-made desktop environment. The main components of it are 
[LightDM](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/LightDM/ "Desktop Manager"), [Openbox](http://openbox.org/ "Window Manager"), 
[Thunar](http://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start "File Manager"), and [Sakura](http://launchpad.net/sakura "Terminal Emulator").

My run of the mill, everyday programs for documents and media include [LibreOffice](http://www.libreoffice.org/ "Office Suite"), 
[GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/ "Graphics Editor"), [mpv](http://mpv.io/ "Media Player"), 
[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/Home "Internet Browser"), and of course 
[Firefox]("http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/desktop/ "Internet Browser"). While I do perfer open-source to proprietary 
software, I do also dual-boot Microsoft Windows for some work applications that won't run under [Wine](http://www.winehq.org/). 

Most of my work done on my laptop (but not my main line of work) is related to web development. I have a local install 
of [Nginx](http://nginx.org/), [PHP](http://php.net/), [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/), and [MariaDB](http://mariadb.org/) 
start on bootup. I do most of the development by hand with [Geany](http://www.geany.org/) and 
[nano](http://www.nano-editor.org/). To tweak I use the following browser plug-ins: 
[Web Developer](http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/), [LiveHTTPHeaders](http://livehttpheaders.mozdev.org/), and 
[Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/). Once it's all debugged, I push the changes to [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/) for 
version control.

While we all hate it, database development is part of the job description. I use [DBeaver](http://dbeaver.jkiss.org/) and 
[SQLite Studio](http://sqlitestudio.pl/) for development. When I need to work on a live database, I typically will upload 
and use [Adminer](http://www.adminer.org/).
